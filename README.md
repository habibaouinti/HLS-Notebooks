This repository hosts a series of Jupyter notebooks aimed at exploring and testing various High-Level Synthesis (HLS) based Intellectual Properties (IPs) using the PYNQ interface. The notebooks serve as a practical and interactive platform for evaluating the performance, functionality, and capabilities of different HLS-based IPs on FPGA platforms. Each notebook is designed to provide a step-by-step guide, allowing users to understand the underlying concepts, configure the IP parameters, and analyze the results. Whether you're a seasoned FPGA developer or a newcomer to the field, these notebooks offer a valuable resource for learning, experimenting, and optimizing HLS-based IP designs.
